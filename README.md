# simple-space-game
It's my first game, so please have mercy.:) I'd like to know what can I improve in terms of:

- the structure of the code
- the performance (currently around 25fps on my machine)
- the design pattern I could potentially use here
- the overall file split and names (I'm sure my_functions, my_classes and my_constants aren't the industry standard)

Thanks!
